### Data Collection Scripts

#### `ticker_fetcher.py`
- Fetches the S&P 500 company tickers from Wikipedia
- Saves the ticker list to `data/processed/ticker_list.json`
- Usage: `python scripts/ticker_fetcher.py`

#### `fetch_company_info.py`
- Retrieves detailed company information using yfinance API
- Collects data like company name, country, sector, and industry
- Saves company information to `data/processed/company_info.csv`
- Usage: `python scripts/fetch_company_info.py`

### Earnings Call Processing

#### `earnings_to_csv.py`
- Downloads earnings call transcripts using the Ninjas API
- Processes transcripts into structured CSV format
- Features:
  - Parses speaker and content from transcripts
  - Saves individual transcripts to `data/processed/transcripts/`
  - Creates earnings dates mapping in `data/processed/earnings_dates.json`
- Usage: `python scripts/earnings_to_csv.py`

#### `metadata_extractor.py`
- Advanced transcript analysis using LLM (OpenAI)
- Key features:
  - Extracts Q&A structure from transcripts
  - Summarizes questions and answers
