Yes, we had a bit of a pull-in from Q2 from Lunar New Year but the business overall was better than expected. And to answer your question, we now have several quarters real orders, real revenue and the sequential growth, the numbers are real. So we're not seeing anything on the macro world that would also dramatically change what has continued to be a very challenging economic market in China. So what gives us confidence is the fact that we've had a number of quarters now, our predictability in the business. The numbers are coming in slightly better than we had anticipated.

And we saw that pretty much across the globe. And I think what we're seeing again is the investments being made in advanced materials relative to the semiconductor supply chain and also the fab is driving productivity. We're seeing continued investment relative to battery, battery development, QA/QC. And I think we continue to see some real nice growth in the PFAS side of our environmental business. Started in the U.S., I think all those applied market secular drivers that we've been pointing to for, for some time, delivered in Q1.

It's still at the beginning of the year, though, so we're kind of banking some of that. What I would say is if you looked across the moving pieces, with the NASD being slightly lower, that would be offset by a little better results in the LSAG side of the business.

The instruments were still down but that is where we're starting to see the relative strength in the pharma business. And that speaks to kind of the long-term growth drivers, I think, in that market.

The half of it's in QA/QC activities for NGS workflows and we're seeing really solid growth in the consumables on that side of things as well as you're starting to see signs of life on the CapEx, not the current because the call churn there yet but that's in a reasonably good shape.

    "answer": "Yes, Jack, thanks for noticing that. That was a real bright spot for us. We actually grew, I think, 2% in the quarter. And this is -- we've been working on this thing for some time to really build out our portfolio and really change our market position in academia research and I think it's starting to show up in the numbers. I think stabilization really is what we're seeing which is the funding is there. And NIH is a relatively really small part of Agilent's business, so really is immaterial. But we're seeing universities have increasingly been funded through private sector. So the money is there. And even so, we saw money in China as well. So it was really a nice global story for us and we're fairly optimistic that, that kind of stabilization can be there for us for the rest of the year.",

Additionally, does the guidance imply Q4 revenue reaching approximately $1.8 billion?",
    "answer": "Doug, this is Bob. I'll take that last one. We'll tell you when we get to Q4 and what I would say but your math is -- in all seriousness, your math is spot on as usual. I think one of the things that we look at is, we look at it a couple of different ways. I think the way to look at it is that first half, second half kind of looking at seasonality, that's probably more instructive given kind of the changes in the growth rates. And when you look at it, as you noticed -- as you mentioned, it is in line with our historical seasonality. And when you look at the growth rates, you're right, we are expecting growth in the back half of the year. A lot of that is, in fact, the easier the compares. And when we actually look at -- what I would ask you to take a look at also is a 2-year stack basis relative to implied Q1 and first half and second half. And what you would see there is a much more smooth number that we also looked at as well. So as usual, you're spot on there.",

    "answer": "Yes, that's a good question. It's a little of both, Josh. So Q2 is relatively intact for what we had originally thought with the exception of that small movement of the China business, that's roughly a point of core growth from Q1 and Q2 switching. What I would say is Q1 also had a beat into it and what we're taking is some of that out of the second half of the year. And so the takeaway is Q2 is spot on from where we expected it to be, absent that kind of shifting the timing shift of China and then the Q2 or the rest of Q1 kind of the beat really helps us in the second half of the year.",
    "insight": "The Q2 guide remains relatively intact with a small movement in China business impacting core growth, while adjustments in the second half of the year account for the beat in Q1, ultimately positioning Q2 as expected and supporting the second half performance."

And it really was a hard-wall, really difficult decision for me but not been contemplating this for a while. And I pulled the Board into the discussion sort of communicating with them because we really wanted to make sure that they had enough time to really run a thorough and thoughtful selection process in which they were able to do.

I would say also there was an element of mix in LSAG and I would expect that to continue to improve. The cost actions that we took weren't fully actualized all and as expected in Q1.
